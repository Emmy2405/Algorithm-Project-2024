This is my Aglorithms Project from Year 1 Semester 2. 
The project consists of analyzing Quality Assurance (QA) logs from an engineering company that manufactures aeronautical equipment across four production lines in Dublin. 
The QA logs track manufacturing issues, resolutions, and other key details for each product batch.  

<h2>Key Tasks:</h2>  

###<h4>Task 1 – Sorting QA Logs</h4>
   - Generate a report for each production line, sorting entries by Product ID, Issue Code, and Date/Time.  
   - The sorting algorithm must be efficient, with a time complexity of O(N log N) or better.  

###<h4>Task 2 – Consolidated Issue Report</h4>
   - Combine issue data from all production lines into a single list, organized by Product ID and Line ID.  
   - The solution must process data in O(N) time or better.  
   - A flowchart must be provided for this task.  

###<h4>Task 4 – Search for Earliest Issue</h4>
   - Implement a search function to find the earliest occurrence of a given issue code for a specific Product ID across all lines.  
   - The search must be highly efficient, running in O(log N) time or better.  

###<h4>Task 4 – Issue Summary Report</h4>
   - Generate a summary report counting the total number of issues per Product ID across all production lines.  
   - The algorithm must run in O(N) time.

- Data Structure Design: A well-structured way to store QA log data.  

- Test Data: Simulated logs with >10 issues/products per line.
  
- Testing Plan: Verification that each task meets performance requirements.
  
- Pseudocode & C Code: Clear logic and functional implementation for Tasks 1-4.
  
- Flowchart (Task 2): Visual representation of the consolidation process.
  
- Project Report: A detailed document (Word/PDF) covering:
  
  - Problem statement, design approach, test plan.
    
  - Pseudocode, C code, and explanations.
    
  - Readable and well-commented code.
